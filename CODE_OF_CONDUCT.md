# Mercedes-Benz Open Source Code of Conduct


## Purpose

The Mercedes-Benz Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Code of Conduct defines the proper behavior and the responsibilities for contributing and participating in FOSS communities to facilitate an open and welcoming culture that encourages active participation, learning, and constructive FOSS community interaction.

The Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct is created based on the [Mercedes-Benz Integrity Code](https://group.mercedes-benz.com/company/compliance/integrity-code.html) and extends and details the Mercedes-Benz Integrity Code with regard to the proper behavior for contribution and participation in FOSS communities. The Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct does not restrict the Mercedes-Benz Integrity Code in any way.

The Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct applies to all FOSS community interactions with Mercedes-Benz, of Mercedes-Benz, within Mercedes-Benz and within the public, whenever an individual is part of or representing a FOSS community.

## Behavior

Participants are committed to contribute and participate in FOSS communities in a harassment-free culture and environment for everyone regardless of gender, sexual identity and orientation, religion, disability, illness, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, nationality, age, level of experience, and education.

Examples for expected behavior to create a positive culture and environment:

* Being nice, friendly, welcoming, and inclusive
* Acting considerate, modest, and respectful
* Criticize constructively and accept constructive criticism
* Respect different points of view and the experiences of individuals
* Encourage for collaboration
* Being mindful and empathetic towards other individuals
* Focusing on benefits for the community
* Using polite and inclusive language

Examples for unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated:

* Intimidating other individuals
* Political or personal attacks as well as publishing private information without permission (e. g. an address)
* Trolling
* Using sexualized language
* Insulting, derogatory, harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments
* Harassment

## Responsibilities

By contributing and participating in Mercedes-Benz managed FOSS communities, external individuals and Mercedes-Benz employees are obliged to comply with the Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct. Contributors are obligated to respect internationally recognized human rights and to promote adherence to them. By contributing and participating in non-Mercedes-Benz managed (external) FOSS communities, Mercedes-Benz employees are obliged to comply with the Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct as well.

Mercedes-Benz is responsible to define the values and put rules for proper behavior into practice and to take appropriate and corrective actions in any case of unacceptable behavior as per this FOSS Code of Conduct. In case of individuals violating the Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct, Mercedes-Benz has the authority to reject, edit, or remove the contributions (e. g. comments, source code commits, and discussion entries) in Mercedes-Benz-managed FOSS communities. In addition, Mercedes-Benz may, but is not obliged to explain why the behavior of the individual negatively impacted other individuals and give a warning in public or in private. Furthermore Mercedes-Benz is allowed to ban participants with inappropriate behavior temporarily or permanently.


## Enforcement

To put the values for proper behavior into practice, the Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct has to be enforced. Any Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct irregularity (e. g. through unacceptable behavior) shall be reported to <foss@mercedes-benz.com>. After reporting a Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct irregularity, the complaint will be evaluated and appropriate action will be taken if deemed necessary. The confidentiality with regard to the reporter of the Mercedes-Benz FOSS Code of Conduct irregularity is ensured by Mercedes-Benz at any time.
